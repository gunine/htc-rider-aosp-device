This is the htc rider device tree we have be working on. Still the ICS AOSP build project in initial stage and it is quite far from done, but I will try my best to develope as much as possible so that there would be the first ICS based AOSP ROM available for htc rider (hTC 4G+). Again thanks everyone for working on this.
